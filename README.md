## Challenges Faced

While developing this project, we encountered several challenges:

1. **Weather Alerts:** Implementing weather alerts was a challenge, and even though most of the code is present, it couldn't be made to work properly. It was pretty hard to test the functionality of this too. Therefore, weather alerts are currently commented out.

2. **React:** Implementing everything with React seemed to be much harder than doing it how we did in a2/a3 somehow. We ran into issues uploading our project to Glitch and had to move to an ec2 instance and that worked a lot better. Getting multiple pages to work was tedious. We also had some trouble with sessions, which we don't know why we were having issues with it since we couldn't get it to work and decided to take a different approach.

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and there are ongoing efforts to improve and enhance its functionality.
